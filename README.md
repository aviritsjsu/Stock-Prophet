# Stock-Prophet

# Introduction

STOCK Prophet is a stock recommendation system The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts future stock prices based on historical data, technical indicators, and market information.

## Features

- **Historical Price Data**: Including opening, closing, high, low prices, and volume.
- **Market Sentiment Indicators**: Sentiment analysis of news articles and social media posts.
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculations based on price and volume data, e.g., RSI, Bollinger Bands.
- **Volatility Measures**: Historical volatility, implied volatility, and standard deviation.
- **Fundamental Data**: EPS, P/E ratio, dividend yield, etc.
- **Correlation with Market Indices**: Understanding the correlation with broader market indices like the S&P 500.

## Installation

To install and set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository

Usage

To use the STOCK Prophet system, you can run the provided scripts to train the model and make predictions:

python
Copy code
# Example usage
from stock_prophet import StockPredictor

predictor = StockPredictor()
predictor.train_model()
predictions = predictor.make_predictions('AAPL')
print(predictions)
For more detailed instructions and examples, please refer to the Usage Guide.

Model

The project leverages advanced recurrent neural network architectures, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models, to capture sequential dependencies in stock price data. These models are well-suited for handling time-series data and capturing complex patterns in stock price movements.

LSTM
LSTM networks contain memory cells and gating mechanisms that regulate information flow, allowing them to capture long-term dependencies and adapt to various prediction tasks.

GRU
GRU networks offer a simpler architecture with fewer parameters compared to LSTM, making them computationally efficient and easier to train, especially on smaller datasets.

Results

The project successfully developed LSTM and GRU models that minimize mean squared error (MSE) and provide valuable insights for investors and traders. For detailed results and performance metrics, refer to the Results Section.

Achievements

Developed a robust stock prediction model using LSTM and GRU architectures.
Achieved significant accuracy improvements over traditional linear regression models.
Provided a comprehensive analysis of market sentiment, technical indicators, and fundamental data.
Future Enhancements

Explore ensemble methods to combine multiple models for improved predictions.
Incorporate additional features such as economic indicators, lagged variables, and external factors.
Continuously refine and iterate on the models based on feedback and new data.
